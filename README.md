## The Problem

Every Soroban transaction requires XLM for gas. Users who hold stablecoins face an onboarding wall:

1. Acquire XLM from an exchange.
2. Fund their Stellar wallet.
3. Manage a second token they don't need — just to pay fees.
4. Heavy infrastructure: existing paymaster solutions require developers to manage complex relayer backends, API keys, and CORS configurations.

This kills conversion for consumer dApps, wallets, and payment flows.

## GasKit vs. Native Fee-Bump

Stellar natively supports Fee-Bump transactions. However, implementing them requires developers to build, host, and secure their own relayer backends to manage private keys and XDR assembly. **Soroban GasKit provides the complete full-stack infrastructure to abstract this entirely.** While developers interact with a zero-configuration SDK, our battle-tested smart contracts and relayer network handle the heavy lifting behind the scenes. Developers get the power of Fee-Bump without writing a single line of backend code.

## The Developer Experience Benchmark

**Without GasKit (Native Fee-Bump)**
Developers must build and maintain their own backend infrastructure to handle XDR assembly, sequence number management, and private key security.
1. Frontend requests transaction build from Backend.
2. Backend queries Soroban RPC for sequence numbers.
3. Backend builds FeeBumpTransaction XDR.
4. Backend signs with the Relayer's Private Key (Security Risk).
5. Backend sends XDR back to Frontend.
6. Frontend asks User to sign the inner transaction.
7. Frontend submits to RPC and handles polling.
*(Estimated: 200+ lines of backend/frontend code + server maintenance)*

**With Soroban GasKit**
Zero backend required. The entire flow is handled client-side in just 3 lines of code.

```javascript
// Drop this directly into your React/Vite frontend. No backend needed.
await gaskit.execute({
  user:           publicKey,
  targetContract: "CUSDC...",
  functionName:   "transfer",
  args:           [from, to, amount],
  signer:         freighterSigner,
});
```

## The Solution

**Soroban GasKit** provides true **gas abstraction** through an action-agnostic SDK. A relayer bot covers the XLM network fee and atomically collects a small token fee (0.0009 USDC) from the user — all in a single transaction.

- **Full-Stack Infrastructure** — You integrate a lightweight client module, while our deployed Rust contracts and Express.js relayer network manage the atomic fee collection and network submission.
- **Any contract call** — transfers, swaps, mints, governance votes.
- **Atomic execution** — fee payment and the user action never partially fail.
- **Zero trust required** — the on-chain contract enforces the fee transfer before forwarding the call.
- **Client-side simplicity** — no API keys or backend proxies required. A truly lightweight, zero-configuration module built for frontend developers.

## Target Business Use Cases

- **Consumer Wallets & Fintech:** Allow users to send cross-border stablecoin payments without ever knowing what "gas" or "XLM" is.
- **DeFi Onboarding:** Enable users to deposit into yield protocols or swap tokens instantly, removing the friction of acquiring network tokens first.
- **B2B Web3 Infrastructure:** Empower other Soroban developers to offer premium, gasless experiences in their own dApps with our plug-and-play SDK.

     Freighter            Simulate TX,              Sign XDR,             execute_proxy
     signs auth           assemble auth             submit TX             fee + action
```

**Flow:**

1. **GasKit SDK** builds the `execute_proxy` transaction using the relayer's account as the source.
2. **GasKit SDK** simulates via Soroban RPC, signs the user's auth entries with Freighter.
3. **Relayer Bot** receives the assembled XDR, signs with its keypair, and submits.
4. **On-chain**, the `FeeForwarder` contract atomically transfers the USDC fee, then forwards the user's contract call.

## Developer Experience

**MVP Status & Integration:** For this hackathon MVP, the SDK is provided as a highly portable, zero-dependency (aside from `stellar-sdk`) ES module (`SorobanGasKit.js`). You can drop it directly into your frontend (`App.jsx` or similar) in any React/Vite/Node project. Publishing to the npm registry (`npm install soroban-gaskit`) with full TypeScript (`.d.ts`) support is our immediate priority for V2.

**Bring Your Own Token (BYOT)**

While this demo showcase uses a specific Testnet USDC, **Soroban GasKit is completely token-agnostic.** Developers are not locked into our token. To use this in your own dApp, simply replace the `feeToken` ID with your own custom Soroban token or stablecoin.

```javascript
import { SorobanGasKit } from "./SorobanGasKit"; // Drop the module into your project

// 1. Initialize the kit with your custom parameters
const gaskit = new SorobanGasKit({
  rpcUrl:           "https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org",
  networkPassphrase: "Test SDF Network ; September 2015",
  contractId:       "CAPDJ4F...UZGSNCY",   // The deployed FeeForwarder contract
  feeToken:         "CA63EPM...LTVNR4",    // REPLACE THIS with your own Token ID!
  relayerUrl:       "https://stellar-gas-station-api.onrender.com/relay",
  relayerPublicKey: "GCF57AY...SHTT5KW",
  feeAmount:        9_000n,                // 0.0009 tokens (assuming 7-decimals)
});

// 2. Wrap any contract call into a gasless transaction
await gaskit.execute({
  user:           publicKey,
  targetContract: "CUSDC...", // Can be a token, NFT, or governance contract
  functionName:   "transfer",  // Any valid function on the target contract
  args:           [from, to, amount],
  signer:         freighterSigner,
});
```

Any Soroban contract call can be wrapped — the SDK is not limited to token transfers.

- Node.js 18+
- [Freighter Wallet](https://freighter.app) browser extension
- Stellar Testnet USDC in your wallet (You can claim this directly via the built-in Faucet in our frontend demo)

### Run Locally

# Relayer Bot
cd relayer-bot
cp .env.example .env        # Add your relayer and faucet secret keys
npm install
node index.js               # Starts on :3001

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                  # Starts on :5173
```

### Deploy the Contract

```bash
cd fee-forwarder
stellar contract build
stellar contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hello_world.wasm \
  --source <DEPLOYER> --network testnet
```

## Security & Known Limitations (Hackathon MVP)

As a V1 MVP built for this hackathon, we prioritized architectural proof-of-concept over production-grade security. A lead developer evaluating this repository should note the following planned improvements for V2:

- **Trustline Base Reserves:** While gas is abstracted, Stellar still natively requires a 0.5 XLM base reserve to establish the initial USDC trustline.
- **Relayer Centralization (SPOF):** The current relayer is a single Express.js instance. Production deployment will require a decentralized relayer network with failover mechanisms.
- **Rate Limiting & Anti-Spam:** The relayer currently lacks IP-based rate limiting or a dynamic fee oracle.
- **Package Management:** The SDK is currently a portable `.js` module. Publishing to npm with full TypeScript support is on the immediate roadmap.

## How It Works (Technical)

The `FeeForwarder` Soroban contract exposes a single entry point:

```rust
pub fn execute_proxy(
    env:             Env,
    fee_token:       Address,    // e.g. USDC
    user:            Address,    // pays the fee
    relayer:         Address,    // receives the fee
    fee_amount:      i128,       // 0.0009 USDC = 9_000
    target_contract: Address,    // any Soroban contract
    function_name:   Symbol,     // any function
    args:            Vec<Val>,   // encoded arguments
) -> Val
```

1. `user.require_auth()` — the user must authorize via Freighter.
2. `token::transfer(user → relayer, fee_amount)` — fee is collected first.
3. `env.invoke_contract(target, fn, args)` — the actual call is forwarded.

If either step fails, the entire transaction reverts. No partial state changes.
